## Files That Will Regenerate

The following files are automatically created by KiCad and will regenerate as needed:
- `.lck` files (lock files) - Created when projects are opened
- `fp-info-cache` - Created when footprints are loaded
- `.wbk` files - Created when KiCad creates workbook backups

## Cleanup Script

The cleanup was performed using: `tools/cleanup_kicad.py`

You can run it again in the future if needed:
```bash
python3 tools/cleanup_kicad.py kicad
```
